FirstNotebook work log


Bug0001: When closing the application and there have been modifications, when you click save, it should then close the application. If you hit cancel, it should not close.
Bug0012: Filename does not necessarily match book name.  If you use explorer and copy a notebook, then open that copy, it will show the name of the original book, and not the filename.
Bug0019: Exception when trying to switch pages.  Not sure why, but the UpdateViewWithPage was called with a null page.  That is because TitleList_SelectionChanged LastSelectedRow returned a row that we did not like.  A search had been implemented, so not all the pages in the book were in the TitleList. 
Bug0020: When you click on the Menu Item File -> New..., and it createst a new document, the title of the window does not remove the filename of the last document.

*********************************************************
Released version 1.1  (Sent to Mike Silva)
*********************************************************
Started work to make search non-blocking (ENH0005).  Using publish/subscribe/cancelToken/tasks.

2018-09-19
ENH0005: Search option should be done in a thread with a cancel token in case the search takes too long as a user could type a character while it is still searching
making the experience sluggish.

2018-10-03
ENH0004: Add Color chooser button to change the selected text.
Also added button to change background of selected text.

2018-10-05
Created button and menu item (and menu shortcut) to enter a TODO tag, and a DONE tag.

2018-10-08
Page Lock: Thoughts - Passkey Hash - Take the password, and generate a hash of it.  Use the password to encrypt the page.  If you ask for the password, and it generates the same hash, then you can assume the password is correct and decrypt the page with the password.

2018-10-16
Bug0013: If in a search, and you change the title, this will throw an exception.
Was trying to set the value of an index when I clicked the "Clear" button.  This was using the page number as an index.  This is not good during a search.  This uncovered another problem where the title was not getting set properly in the titleListView. The list was getting generated, before the saving of the page causing the list not to reflect the new name of the page.
*********************************************************
Publish Version 1.3.0
*********************************************************

2018-10-22
Bug0014: TitleListView is not being updated when you add/change content of a page.
Working on: ENH0006: When in search mode, make the text area read only.  Switch to edit mode at some point.  When making the textarea focused, re-draw the textarea to remove any search hilighting.  - Need to handle "Find Next" - while textarea is focused.

2018-10-23
ENH0006: When in search mode, make the text area read only.  Switch to edit mode at some point.  When making the textarea focused, re-draw the textarea to remove any search hilighting.
Finished ENH0006. 

2019-01-25
Bug0015: Search finds a text string with an index after the end of the page.
Placed a try-catch around the section that attempts to hilight the text.  Also created a new class "ErrorHandler" that can be called when we want to inform the user of an error that was caught, and handled.

2019-07-21
Bug0016: Text is lost when switching out of the program.  If you have searched for something and still have the search token in the search bar, and then type text into the window, the text does not stay if you switch out of the application by using the hot key <Ctrl>-<tab>.  Very strange.
Fixed this by clearing the _searchToken when you focus in the text area.  It just needs to be set again if a search next is called.
Bug0017: File Save/ File Open does not open the saved file successully (2019-07-21)
Fixed this by not reading the pagetags until AFTER the pages are deserialized.  Strangely the pages get deserialized after the book is deserialized.

2019-08-19
Bug0018: Lost the Scroll bar to the RichTextBox
Put the RichTextBox inside a Panel.  Then make the RichTextBox fill the entire panel.  The panel control works better inside the split control.

2019-12-15
Bug0021: Can not delete a page.  The delete menu item does nothing.
Fixed/Implemented.
Also change a lot of types to "var".

2019-12-15
Started Page Lock functionality.  Created a dialog box that requests a password.

2020-07-21
Bug0022: If you click on New Page after editing a page that you found doing a search, I get an error saying "Error in FirstNotebook.Form1 Method: UpdateViewWithPage Message: Page is null."
Fixed this.  Removed an accidental clearing of the _searchToken in teh NoteView_Focus method.

2021-02-09
ENH0008: Autosave - Automatically save the current document to a temp file while the program is running.  Perform this auto-save every 20 minutes.

2021-02-10
  DONE: Only start the thread saving if the file is dirty.  
  DONE: When you save a file, delete the temp file.
  DONE: When you open a file, and there is a temp file, display a message and cancel.
  Bug0023: After opening the file, and if you hit the "New" button, you will not ever see the file go dirty.

2022-03-04
  Bug0024:Error when doing multiple changes to a page simultaneously. EG document has not been modified, but then you put a DONE tag in the document.
  This is possibly some race condition.  I can't reproduce it, but I put a check before I start the background save thread. (Fix in Form1.cs - line 207.)

2022-07-11
  Bug0025: 2022-07-11 - While in search, and you edit the page, if you switch to a different application, then back, the changes are gone.
    Created new event handler SearchTextBox_LooseFocus.

2022-09-06
  ENH0010: 2022-09-06 If a backup file exists, give the person an option to use the backup file.
    If the user says yes, then rename the original to filename.eno.bak2, and rename the backup to filename.eno.
